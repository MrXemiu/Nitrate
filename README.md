Installation
---

Simply copy the content of the Nitrate repo somewhere, for example:

	:::powershell
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:Ventajou/nitrate.git

To make your life easier, I strongly recommend creating an alias to Nitrate in your PowerShell profile. To do that, create or edit **Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1** in your Windows Documents folder and add the following line:

	:::powershell
	New-Alias no3 <path to nitrate>\nitrate.ps1

Quick Start
---

You will need a PowerShell command line which provides you with the Visual Studio environment settings, an example of how do do that can be found [on my blog](http://ventajou.com/all-in-one-command-prompt-for-windows-developers).

Once installed, open a new PowerShell session (so it picks up the alias) and go into an empty directory, then run:

	no3 init

This will simply create a configuration file for Nitrate in this folder, the file is called NitrateConfig.ps1 and it contains the default settings. Feel free to edit any of those settings to match your environment and preferences.

Once you're ready to set up Orchard, type:

	no3 setup

It will take a little while because the Orchard source code is downloaded and compiled. But once done, you'll have an Orchard environment ready for setup.

File Organization
---

One goal of Nitrate is to separate your code from Orchard's so that you don't need to commit all of Orchard into your source control system. A standard Nitrate setup contains the following folders:

* **orchard**: the Orchard source code, make sure your source control client ignores that folder.
* **source**: should contain your source code.
	* **modules**: contains your modules. Each folder in there is symlinked to the Orchard modules folder by the **setup** command.
	* **modules**: contains your themes. Each folder in there is symlinked to the Orchard themes folder by the **setup** command.
	* **media**: this folder is symlinked to the Orchard media folder by the **setup** command.
* **db**: contains your database backup

If you wish to create a separate solution for your themes and modules, I recommend saving the .sln file under the source folder. Also when you use the create-module command, you will need to adjust the location of the referenced Orchard assemblies.
